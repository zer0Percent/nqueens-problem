# nqueens-problem
Given a chess board of size NxN, How many possible ways are there to put N queens so that they cannot atack each other?

This a typical problem that a brute force algorithm is your ally. 
A back-tracking algorithm is proposed in order compute all the possibles ways to achieve this task.
However, it may take a while to compute this because these kind of algorithms are used to take O(n!) or exponentials order in time.

So, if you want to do some tweaking with the N parameter, here's the code :-)
